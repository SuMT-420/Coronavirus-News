                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> virus.
                <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> virus is  The first known case was identified in <i><b>Wuhan, China</b></i>, in December 2019.
                The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Coronavisruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.
                Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
                COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the world as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illness.
                However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
                Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.<br><br>

                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.
                The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. 
                The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron, and Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences."<br>
                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.
                Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.
                After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.<br>
                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.

            <p><font size="4">
                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>The virus can spread from an infected person's mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. 
                These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
                You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
                The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.
                This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.
                Infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms, although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom onset.
                Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.
                Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.
                Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.
