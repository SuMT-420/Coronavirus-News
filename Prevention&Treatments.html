                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
                Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility.
                This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
                Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cov er coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.

                <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others.
                Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.
                Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
                You should wear a mask if you have COVID-19, whether or not you are required to. 
                And if you have any respiratory symptoms such as a cough or sneezing, wearing a mask makes sense: if you have undiagnosed COVID-19 it will protect people around you from the virus.
                Even if you don't have COVID-19 but have a bad cold or flu, it's worth protecting people - for people with weak immune systems, these illnesses can still take a heavy toll.
